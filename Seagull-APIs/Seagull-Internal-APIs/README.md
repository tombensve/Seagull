# Seagull-Platform-APIs

This contains APIs for implementing the Seagull platform, not implementing services
using it!

When it comes to implementation of these APIs, each interface should have an implementation
**in an own jar!** 

You should be able to pick one implementation of SGRouter and one of SGServiceLocator! 

For Seagull implementation code, both this and the _Seagull-Service-APIs_ will be needed as
dependencies.

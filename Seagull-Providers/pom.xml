            Seagull-Implementations
        
        Description
            Seagull - Intended to be a very simplistic service platform.
            
            The idea here is to define a service platform that says
            nothing about how services communicate with each other.
            This defines APIs and not to many of those, that can be
            implemented with whatever protocol. What protocol is used
            depends on what implementation you make available on
            the classpath. Implementations are fetched using
            SGProviderLookup (currently ServiceLoader is used).

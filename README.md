_I suck at comming upp with names, and a seagull just flew by my balcony ..._

_Seagulls are also apparenbtly quite smart, and have equality between male and female. They are also amazing flyers that can navigate airstreams without visibly moving their wings._

So, what is this about ? 

It is about information flying around between different services, triggering things to be done, in simple terms. 

**NOTE:** This is my reboot / rethinking of my APS project and is like APS a playground where I'm having fun, and stimulating my brain.

(Local individual)

_I suck at coming upp with names, and a seagull just flew by my balcony ..._

_Seagulls are also apparently quite smart, and have equality between male and female. They are also amazing flyers that
can navigate air streams without visibly moving their wings._

So, what is this about ?

It is about information flying around between different services, triggering things to be done, in simple terms.

**NOTE:** This is my reboot / rethinking of my APS project and is like APS a playground where I'm having fun, and
stimulating my brain.

A sub goal is to keep things very simple, though not by pretending something is something it really isn't!

It is done to 100% in Groovy and will use Closures, which does not exist in Java (looks like lambdas, definitely
aren't! See <https://groovy-lang.org/closures.html>).

# Seagull

(Local individual)

_I suck at coming upp with names, and a seagull just flew by my balcony ..._

_Seagulls are also apparently quite smart, and have equality between male and female. They are also amazing flyers that
can navigate air streams without visibly moving their wings._

So, what is this about ?

It is about information flying around between different services, triggering things to be done, in simple terms.

**NOTE:** This is my reboot / rethinking of my APS project and is like APS a playground where I'm having fun, and
stimulating my brain.

A sub goal is to keep things very simple, though not by pretending something is something it really isn't!

It is done to 100% in Groovy and will use Closures, which does not exist in Java (looks like lambdas, definitely
aren't! See <https://groovy-lang.org/closures.html>).

_Note_ that all development tasks now are in my personal YouTrack instance since YouTrack is so much nicer. I started
using GitHub issues for dev tasks because getting IDEA and YouTrack to talk was impossible! This has worked 
before, but not any longer. But installing the YouTrack plugion into IDEA solved this. So when I can use
YouTrack, it is so much nicer.

(Local individual)

_I suck at coming upp with names, and a seagull just flew by my balcony ..._

_Seagulls are also apparently quite smart, and have equality between male and female. They are also amazing flyers that
can navigate air streams without visibly moving their wings._

So, what is this about ?

It is about information flying around between different services, triggering things to be done, in simple terms.

**NOTE:** This is my reboot / rethinking of my APS project and is like APS a playground where I'm having fun, and
stimulating my brain.

A sub goal is to keep things very simple, though not by pretending something is something it really isn't!

It is done to 100% in Groovy and will use Closures, which does not exist in Java (looks like lambdas, definitely
aren't! See <https://groovy-lang.org/closures.html>).

_Note_ that all development tasks were in my personal YouTrack instance since YouTrack is so much nicer. I started
using GitHub issues for dev tasks because getting IDEA and YouTrack to talk was impossible! This has worked 
before, but not any longer. But installing the YouTrack plugin into IDEA solved that. ... Well at least for some 
hours! The next day it was dead again, without me having done anything since it worked the previous day. 

I took the fight again to make this work, but finally gave upp! So I had to copy all my YouTrack issues to 
GitHub again, after having copied the Github ones to YouTrack, and deleted them in Github. I will now completely
give up on having IDEA and YouTrack talking to each other. I will never ever try that again. It is a big
waste of time. 2 products from the same company that refuses to have anything to do with each other!

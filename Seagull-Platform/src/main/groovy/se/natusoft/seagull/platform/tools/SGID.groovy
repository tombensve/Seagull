 *     Name
 *         Seagull-Platform
 *     
 *     Description
 *         Seagull - Currently a playground where I'm having fun.
 *         
 *         The idea here is to define a service platform that says
 *         nothing about how services communicate with each other.
 *         This defines APIs and not to many of those, that can be
 *         implemented with whatever protocol. The first implementation
 *         provided will be using REST. The actual services you write
 *         with this will however not know, nor care about that!
 *         
 *         THIS IS HOWEVER NOT a hide reality, making something look
 *         like something else it really isn't just to make it seem
 *         simpler! Any use of this requires a full comprehension of
 *         reality.

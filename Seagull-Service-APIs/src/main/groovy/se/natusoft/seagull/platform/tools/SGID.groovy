 *     Name
 *         Seagull-Platform
 *     
 *     Description
 *         Seagull - Intended to be a very simple service platform.
 *         
 *         The idea here is to define a service platform that says
 *         nothing about how services communicate with each other.
 *         This defines APIs and not to many of those, that can be
 *         implemented with whatever protocol. What protocol is used
 *         depends on what implementation you make available on
 *         the classpath.
